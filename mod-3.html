        <h2>Adding CSS</h2>
        <p>While there are multiple ways to give html css properties, the one we will be focusing on as professional developers is linking a style sheet.</p>
        <p>A seperate css file will be created with all the applicable propeties for a page. Inside the head of the html, a link tag will be used. The link will have the 'rel' attribute of 'stylesheet' and the 'href' of the location of the stylesheet. This can be local or hosted online.</p>
        <p>link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css"</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p>A selector is how we choose and modify an html element.</p>

        <h3>Type Selector</h3>
        <p>Selects the element by element name. Just the name of the element.</p>
        <p>p {}</p>
        <p>div {}</p>

        <h3>Class Selector</h3>
        <p>Selects the element by all matching classes. Prepended by a dot (.)</p>
        <p>.purple-text {}</p>
        <p>.profile-pic {}</p>

        <h3>ID Selector</h3>
        <p>Selects element by ID. Prepended by a hashtag (#)</p>
        <p>#carosel {}</p>
        <p>#nav-bar {}</p>

        <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
        <p>Selects ALL elements. Only the wildcard/asterik (*)</p>
        <p>* {}</p>

        <h3>Attribute Selectos</h3>
        <p>Selects specific elements that have a certain attribute. The element name followed by the attribute in square brackets.</p>
        <p>a[href] {}</p>
        <p>img[src] {}</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>CSS Selector Combinations</h2>
        <p>We can chain together several different selectors to target very specific elements.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Elements</h3>
        <p>A comma between elements will add that element to a list that targets them all.</p>
        <p>h1, h2, h3 {}</p>

        <h3>Compund Selectors</h3>
        <p>Naming two elements right after the other (with no space in-between) will select all elements A WITH the class of B.</p>
        <p>.profile-pic.admin {}</p>

        <h3>Descendant Selectors</h3>
        <p>Naming an element after another with a space in-between will target all elements B that are any degree of children of A. They do not have to be directly connected. Essentially if B is contained within element A in any way.</p>
        <p>.guild-card .card-text {}</p>

        <h3>Direct Child Selector</h3>
        <p>Naming an element after another with a '>' between them will target only the immidiate children B of parent A. Must be a direct connection.</p>
        <p>,guild-card > img {}</p>

        <h3>Adjacent Children</h3>
        <p>Naming an element after another with '+' between will target all B elements that come right after A.</p>
        <p>ul + li {}</p>
